Saltiest Hacker News Trolls

Name
Saltiest Hacker News Trolls

Pitch
Build an app that uses Hacker News comment data to rank commenters based on comment sentiment (saltiness/negativity).

MVP
App rates and ranks hacker news commenters by negativity of comment sentiment (limited to commenters who have made x number of posts). Allows users to search by username to view comments and sentiment levels of specific users.

DS: 
- Decide what volume/frequency of user comments to use as a threshold (i.e. top 1000 most frequent users)
- Score HN user negativity using sentiment analysis techniques on their comments 
- Rank-order users based on negativity score and do the same with their top n comments
- Make rankings and comments accessible to the rest of the team. E.g. deploy rankings via Flask App (or equivalent) to receive inputs (HN username), and output negativity score & ranking in JSON format.

Web:
- User creation/login flow
- User can view a feed of negative comments from DS API
- User can save their favorite salty comments to the backend
- User can delete saved comments

Stretch
App also displays the sentiment of individual comments by user allowing drilldown to a user view.

DS:
- Expand the scope of the sentiment analysis beyond positive or negative to include things like humor, etc. 
- Provided dataset extends only to late 2017. Source additional data and leverage it to improve your model. 
- Help create visualizations for the trolls that show up most frequently

Web:
- Create a way to share the funniest/worst trolls on twitter.
- Use filter to display the cards in different ways depending on what the user wants to see and what is available in the DS API (ie funniest, most sarcastic, etc.)
- Create a way to visualize the trolls that show up most frequently in a given time period.
